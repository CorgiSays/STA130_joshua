    "- No significant relationship, social anxiety affects people equally in rural, urban and larger urban settings. This would mean that potential focus could be placed overall across all environments and locations.\n",
    "- Significant relationship, social anxiety affects people in rural and urban settings differently. This would mean potential focus and resources could be designated to the environment which needs it most."

    "This relates to the course project’s objective as it can be used to determine the effect age plays on how an individual feels their overall life is going. In my third analysis, I will be analyzing the effect that overall life satisfaction plays in regards to an individual’s depression. This second analysis allows for effectively analyzing three variables and determining their relationships. A further sub-analysis I would like to do regarding this category is to categorize “pre-covid” and “post-covid” high school years.\n",

    "- No correlation\n",
    "    There is no correlation, little to no focus needs to be placed on an individual’s age when considering the prospects of this course project.\n",
    "- Non Linear Correlation (I’m really not sure what this is called necessarily)\n",
    "    In relation to the COVID high school theory, it could be that the overall life satisfaction varies depending on age, and dips at various ages such as around graduation or mid-life."
