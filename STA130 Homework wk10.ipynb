    "1.1) The difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression is dependent on the number of variables/predictors they each take. In the case of single linear regression, the formula is $$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon$$, where x is the predictor and y is the variable. However, in the case of multiple linear regression, it takes multiple predictor variables to calculate a single output. The formula for multiple linear regression is $$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_n x_n + \\epsilon$$. Independent/predictor variables are the variables we associate with change, for example, in the case of the housing market, the variable y is the output, and can be represented by something like the housing price. A variable x could be the age of the house, and potentially in the case of multiple linear regresison, there could be additional variables such as the neighbourhood safety, city, and other pieces of data. As directly mentioned before, multiple linear regression holds more benefits over single linear regression as it gives us more control over the variables and as such, we can determine more information using more variables, isolating causes for potential rises and decreasing the chance for errors.\n",

    "1.2) As shown in last week's homework with the water eruptions, regarding the continuous variable and indicator variable in parameter testing, a continuous variable is akin to a histogram covering each individual point. There are no bins and the data is ungrouped. However, in an indicator variable testing, we are able to convert the data to a binary value which lets us determine the difference between two things if we're roughly sure about what could cause a change. Using the example from last week, with water geyser eruptions, we were roughly able to determine that the thing having an effect was the duration and as such, we were able to split the data into two bins of \"short\" vs \"long' waits.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3) A continuous variable, as mentioned above, shows individual differences, or almost a \"minute by minute\" or \"item by item\" breakdown of the thing being tested as the perdictor variable. However, the indicator variable groups that into large groups, and as such, you could see the effect of a certain variable and its effects on the output variable. This could be beneficial as it would change the data in accordance with now having two sources of input, in that it can capture things specific to a certain group of data, whilst also accounting for the minute by minute or item by item breakdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4) Assuming this is relatively similar to what was discussed in Question 1.3, the graph will now have a slight slope dependent on the group. ChatGPT provided an example of the impact of income and life satisfaction between those with vs without a college degree. This would let us determine if income has a larger effect on life satisfaction on those with a degree, vs those without a degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.5) This question utilized a lot of big words, but the way I understand it is that you are converting a non binary categorical variable (something that is likely continuous) into a set of indicator variables. In this case, we can categorize the data into many groups which functionally would work as a lot of indicator variables. We could see the effects of various \"bins\" of people within a certain category. As an example, we might set the outcome variable to be the housing price, then set a categorical variable as something like house location (downtowns, suburbs, countryside). The indicators could be \"1 if in suburbs, 0 otherwise) and (1 if in downtown, 0 otherwise). In this example we would have the baseline housing price be the price in the countryside, and anywhere where the bin = 1 for each of the indicator variables be for its respective location. "

    "2.1) In the case of the question, the outcome variable (y) would likely be something like the revenue/sales generated by the ad campaign. The predictor variables would be the money spent on online advertising and the money spent on TV advertising (which is 100% less effective with a near guarantee. this is 2024). After speaking with ChatGPT, there are multiple potential interaction effects but one provided by ChatGPT was discussing the impact of TV ads after already having online ads. Having reinforcement on both TV and online could result in a more effective ad campaign. The equations used would be the same as the multiple lienar regression method, with the one involving an interaction also adding on a third variable being TV spend + online spend or any other interaction between the two. We can use the formulas to make predictions about the outcome by simply plugging in values, for example in the case of the formula involving interaction, indicated by $$\\text{Sales} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{TV Spend}) + \\beta_2 (\\text{Online Spend}) + \\beta_3 (\\text{TV Spend} \\times \\text{Online Spend}) + \\epsilon$$, we could choose two values of how much you would potentially spend on TV, and how much you would potentially spend on online advertising. You would then multiply by a previously determined coefficient, in these examples, beta. As a result, you are simply plugging in numbers. in the case of the differences between the formulas with and without interaction, it is exactly as it states. In one, you add on the possibility for interaction between the two forms of advertising and its effects on your campaigns, and in the other, you simply assume they are completely independent with little to no overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2) We would simply be converting these into two indicator variables, letting ITV be 1 if it is high spending and 0 if it is low spending. We then use the same formulas as above, but simply changing the TV spend and online spend variables to be the indicators respectively. The outcome will likely be roughly the same but just less detailed, simply focusing on the \"high vs low\" spending."

    "4) In this equation, we see that the R squared value is 0.176, which can be converted into being 17.6%. This means that the model explains for 17.6% of the variability in the data. This could mean that there are other key variables missing from the calculation, meaning that there is missing data and potentially more variables that need to be made and related to the HP, which in this case is the dependent variable. The predictor variables of the pokeaman's special defense and their generation are combined to basically see how the effect of the special defense on the pokeaman's health differs generation to generation. The explanation for the coefficients being larger than 10 whilst having strong or very strong evidence against the null hypothesis of \"no correlation\" can be explained by the two numbers referencing very different things. In the case of the R-squared variable, it is solely talking about the fit of the model and not necessarily the individual significance of the predictor model. However, in the case of the coefficients being larger than 10 whilst having strong evidence against the null hypothesis, this does not directly correspond to the fit of the model and instead focuses on the individual significance of each variable. The low R squared means that whilst there is signficiant effects on the outcome, they only account for a very small variability in the graph and much of it is left unexplained. The small p values mean that the predictors are still related to the outcome, though not being the only outcome it appears."

    "In this conversation, we explored various aspects of a multiple linear regression model applied to data where the dependent variable, HP, is predicted using \"Special Defense\" (Sp. Def) and \"Generation\" as predictor variables. We discussed how R-squared, specifically a value of 17.6% in this model, reflects the proportion of variability in HP explained by the model. This relatively low R-squared indicates that while the predictors have some statistically significant effects on HP, they collectively account for only a modest amount of its overall variance, suggesting that other factors might influence HP or that it is highly variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes \"Special Defense\" as a continuous predictor and \"Generation\" as a categorical variable, with dummy variables representing different generations. In the second model specification, an interaction term between \"Special Defense\" and \"Generation\" is added to allow the effect of \"Special Defense\" on HP to vary across generations. This interaction term is useful in scenarios where the relationship between HP and \"Special Defense\" might differ by generation, potentially capturing a more nuanced effect. The syntax of the model is structured in Python using statsmodels formula API, and we discussed the difference between including an interaction term (Q(\"Sp. Def\"):C(Generation)) and using main effects alone in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the addition of interactions provides insight into whether predictor effects vary by category, though the overall low R-squared suggests limited predictive power from the variables included.\n",

However, when taking into consideration the pokeaman's status as a legendary vs a non legendary, as well as their speed, we can see that the R squared value is significantly higher at nearly 50%. This means that it can explain up to 50% of the variation in the graph. There is still a long way to go, but this is a signficant and noticeable improvement in how accurate the model is."

    "6) Model4_linear_form creates new predictor variables for Sp Def, Sp Atk, Legendary and Speed. It then takes into account the interactions between each of the variables. As a result the data is \"more accurate\" as to capturing the true nature of the graph, however, the data ends up becoming very multicollinear, meaning that many of the predictors are super correlated and as a result, the model cannot easily tell the difference between what each predictor does for the overall model. This could mean that the model is less accurate to the overall data, as it could be super accurate to the model but super inaccurate to new unseen data as there is simply not enough information due to how correlated and simialr some pieces of data are. In short, the model is not able to tell what one thing does and what another thing does, because to the model they seem too correlated to have their own independent differences."

    "7) Model 5 expands from model 3 and 4 by the following:\n",
    "In model 3, you initially just take into consideration attack and defense, then in model 4 you also take into account the speed, the legendary status and the special defense stats and their interactions with the other variables. However, in model 5, you remove the unnecessary interactions and only pay attention to the variables with likely more implication. In this case, you are taking into account attack, defense, speed, legendary status, special defense, special attack, and lastly the generation and type of the pokemon. In the fourth model, you took into consideration interactions between attack and everything else, which led into a lot of overlap. However, swapping the * signs out for + signs resulted in it to stop considering the implication and simply to account for the new data. This improves upon model 3 by adding more information, improves upon model 4 by reducing the number of unnecessary and overlapping interactions, and finally, improves upon both by taking into consideration the pokemon's generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.2) A major downside of Model 5 was the generality in which it handled the data. Model 6 replaces the generation, legendary status, and types of the pokemon with simply focusing on whether or not the pokemon is Normal, Water, from Generation 2 or from Generation 5. It does this by setting them as indicator variables, where if the pokemon's main type is normal, it would satisfy the indicator variable for the normal type. This will result in a lot more nuance and specific data regarding the normal and water type pokemons, allowing you to tell the difference between normal, water, and every other pokemon type. It further lets you take into account the differences between generation 2, generation 5, and those belonging to a generation that isnt generation 2 or 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.3) in the case of model 7, model 7 reimplements a lot of the interaction terms which were removed previously going from Model 4 to Model 5. It adds interactions between each of the variables yet again in a way that makes a bit more sense than in Model 4. This enables the model to determine the relationships between each of the predictor variables and likewise, the HP variable (dependent variable). The conditional number in model 7 after scaling and centering ends up becoming as low as 15.4, down from the ridiculously high e+16 numbers that Model 4 had. This means that the model can accurately determine the effect of each of the variables with a much higher certainty and less uncertainty between what each predictor variable's impact might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale between each of these changes was to focus on specific categories, narrowing each of the scopes of what you were looking at. In the first few models, you were just looking at the general interactions between each of the pokeamans. However, as you reach the later points, you see narrowing of the scope down to comparing the difference between pokemon types, pokemon generations, and the like. "

    "8) The way this works is by splitting the data provided into two sets, the training and testing sets. They will each account for 50% of the data provided. A linear model is fit to the training data each time using the code, indicated by the red line. Anything that sits near the line indicates that the model has similar performance between the training dataset and the testing dataset. If it's above the line, it could mean that the line is overfitted to the training data. Otherwise, it could mean that it is underfitting and not capturing necessary patterns. In the example shown here, it appears that the model is underfitting relatively consistently, as after running this about 30 times, the data is repeatedly \"under\" more often. However, in some variations, it is a relatively equal split and as such, it could be safe to assume that the model is relatively accurate. "

    "9) The model here illustrates that when using Model 7, in this case specifically talking about the \"original\" dataset provided to it, the in sample R squared is relatively good at 0.378, meaning that it can account for 37.8% of the variation in the model. However, the out of sample R squared is also quite high in this, at 0.350. This means that the model is relatively good at generalizing the data in relation to the model of linear regression made. If this number were higher, it would indicate that it is better at generalizing and would imply that the level of multicollinearity is relatively low, as the model is good at determining what impact each variable has on the overall result. When using generation 1 data, the in sample R squared is very high, this is to be expected as Model 7 was trained on generation 1 data, with indicator variables focused specifically on that. As a result, the in sample R squared is super high at 0.573. However, when acounting for the out of sample R squared, we find that it sits closer to 0.111, which means that it accounts for 11% of the variation. This suggests that in relation to the training set, which is what In Sample is accustomed to, the model performs very well. However, it is very bad when it comes to taking things it hasn't seen before and applying it like so. This could suggest that the multicollinearity for this model is relatively high and as such, the model is worse at generalization. A similar result is found when it is fed data from generation 1 to 5, in order to predict generation 6. The in sample R squared is relatively good at just under 35% of the variation being explained, but when given the task of generalizing the data, it struggles, resulting an out of sample R squared of 0.234, meaning it accounts for 23% of the variation.\n",

    "Model 6 experiences a similar result, however, its out of sample R squared is consistently higher than the out of sample R squared faced in Model 7. However, alongside that, the in sample R squared for predicting the future is generally lower, never really surpassing 0.45, which means that Model 7, being more complex, is better at accounting for the specifics of the data set it is trained on. However, when given the task of generalizing new data, Model 7 has been overtrained on the data that it has been provided, and is too accustomed to the nuances such that when given a new task with new data, it is slightly worse at generalizing. Model 6 has less nuance and is simpler overall, which means that when given new data, it is relatively good at adapting. ChatGPT worded it in a good way in which model 7 is likely to overfit due to learning \"idiosyncratic\" (patterns that really have no correlation and are likely coincidence) patterns in the data which should not be applied to the larger dataset."

    "In this conversation, we discussed the evaluation and interpretation of models in the context of predicting Pokémon stats across different generations. We focused on comparing the performance of two models (Model 6 and Model 7) using in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values. Model 7, which is more complex and involves several interaction terms, initially showed higher in-sample R-squared values, indicating a better fit to the training data. However, when we tested its ability to predict future data, particularly for Generation 1, the model's out-of-sample R-squared was significantly lower, suggesting poor generalizability. This drop in performance is attributed to overfitting, where the complexity of Model 7 led it to capture noise and idiosyncratic patterns specific to the training data, which did not hold when applied to new, unseen data. In contrast, simpler models like Model 6, with fewer interaction terms, displayed more robust out-of-sample performance and generally showed stronger evidence for their coefficients, making them potentially more reliable and interpretable. The conversation highlighted the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability, emphasizing that simpler models often offer better generalizability and are easier to interpret, particularly when performance differences between models are not substantial.\n",
